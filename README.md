# All-About-Me
Hi, welcome to my portfolio site. Hope you enjoy your stay!
This portfolio site is a reflection of who I am—my projects, my skills, and my journey. It showcases work I've done during my academic studies, personal projects, and anything else I’m proud of.
I designed and built it to be clean, modern, and easy to navigate—just like a good user experience should be.
